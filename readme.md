## Google CSE Widget

A WordPress plugin for Google Custom Search Engine. It does two things:

1) Registers a sidebar widget, which lets you specify your CSE ID and the URL of your results page (another page on your WP installation). The widget then displays the search field on the front end.
2) Registers a shortcode [gcsew-results]. Put this shortcode on your chosen results page (as specified in the widget settings).

The plugin is a bit hackish, and definitely won't work for more than one CSE ID on a given site. Use at your own risk.
